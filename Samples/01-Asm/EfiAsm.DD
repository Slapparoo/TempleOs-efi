The Most Basic of examples


This is not designed to be run in TempleOS it is designed to be run in UEFI


To Build
Cursor over Build.HC and hit F5
whic will generate EfiAsm.BIN.Z and EfiAsm.efi


The resulting EfiAsm.efi application can be inspected with EfiFileDump("EfiAsm");


Once happy it can be copied to a UEFI boot parition 

A good way to run them is in VirtualBox in EfiShell (which is already installed in VirtualBox)
